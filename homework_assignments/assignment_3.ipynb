    "* Each student must complete their own assignment individually.\n",

    "  * The use of ChatGTP, Copilot, or other AI assistants is **not allowed**\n",
    "* The code must run in Colab or JupyterHub without errors.\n",
    "  * Code that does not run will not receive any credit.\n",
    "  * I suggest double-checking that your code runs properly in a new session. Sometimes code can be broken but appear to work because of old state in the notebook."
